				Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born.

			<div id="idealist">
				The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable. 
				(The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.

			<div id="repeat">
				Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum:

				There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls;

			<div id="each-shelf">
				each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format;

				<br>each page, of forty lines, 
				<br>each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. 
			</div>

			<div id="letters">
				There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say.
 				<br>I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history)
