				<b>First</b>: The Library exists ab aeterno. 
			</div>

			<div id="first-content">
				This truth, whose immediate corollary is the future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind. Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi; the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can only be the work of a god. To perceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.
			</div>

			<div id="second-headline">
				<b>Second</b>: The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number<div class="symbol"><b>^</b></div>

				<div class="note">
					This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library   and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div id="second-content">
				One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's palm... They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)

				For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages.

			<div id="repeat-true">
				<div id="true">All this, I repeat, is true,</div> but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was formulated by its originators.
				<br><br>Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon 2 came upon a book as confusing as the others, but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition.

			<div id="law">
				 These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the <b>fundamental law of the Library</b>. This thinker observed that <b>all the books</b>, no matter how diverse they might be, <b>are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet.</b> He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed:

				In the vast Library there are no two identical books.

			<div id="premise">
				From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that <b>the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols</b> 
				(a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite):
